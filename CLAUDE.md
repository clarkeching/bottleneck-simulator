# Bottleneck Simulator

## Project Info
- Simple HTML/JS simulation demonstrating how bottlenecks constrain throughput
- Single file: `index.html`
- Live site: https://bottleneck.clarkeching.com (GitHub Pages, auto-deploys from GitHub)

## Workflow
- Don't push to GitHub until I say "deploy"
- Each push triggers a GitHub Pages deploy
- Pull before starting if working from a different machine

## Key Details
- Bottleneck worker (position 3) works 3x slower than others
- Day runs for 21 seconds, output is always reported as 20 items
- Multi-day mode: WIP carries over between days
